Visual Pollution Detection
The purpose of the project is to facilitate the research procedures for observers and specialists in visual pollution. Artificial intelligence, computer vision, and neural network technologies were used to assist officials in making decisions to remove visual pollution. The machine was trained with a set of visual pollution data, classified and then predicted. The EfficientNet-B0 algorithm was used, and it is considered one of the fastest algorithms that have achieved high accuracy in recent scientific research. The data was a set of images related to visual pollution, and it was taken into account in the training for horizontal and vertical imaging, and that the machine is trained on regular photography and drone photography, in addition to the training was done for the images according to the time of day and night and according to the weather condition (clouds, rain, dust , sunny) so that the machine is trained according to the type of camera, meaning that the camera is not required to have high specifications
